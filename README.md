### Hello everyone :purple_heart:
I'm very passionate about technology and being able to use it to help people solve their problems is amazing.

- I'm a Fullstack Developer
- I am currently a Development Manager at **CBK Software**
- I love helping with social projects
- I work with ZendFramework, AngularJS, among other tecs that surround them
- I attended Rocketseat's GoStack, where I fell in love with React and NodeJS, which is the stack I'm 100% focused on currently.
- Literally in love with Linux
- WoW player (World of Warcraft)
